		<h1>The Great American DineOut</h1>
		<article class="row-fluid">
			<div class="span6">
				<p>Each year, Share Our Strength's Great American DineOut event supports the No Kid Hungry campaign with a nationwide fundraising effort to end childhood hunger in America. Strength turned to us to create a simple and impactful way for people nationwide to find information about sponsors, locations, and how to participate in this food-focused fundraiser in their own communities. Strength used multiple marketing tools and created a unified voice across campaigns to ensure the success of DineOut. Participants could RSVP directly via the map's integration with Facebook or Open Table. This led to 35.8 million impressions and over 5.2 million followers reached.</p>

				<p>We designed and developed a customized mapping technology that that effectively presented information about the sponsors participating in the fundraiser. The nationwide map gives site visitors the ability to search for participating restaurants in their local area. From there, visitors can RSVP via Facebook, view restaurants’ Twitter streams, or make reservations to dine at the establishment—all without leaving the map.</p>

			<article class="span6 l">
				<p>We enhanced performance and reliability through the use of the latest HTML5, jQuery, jQuery Mobile and Google V3 Map front-end technologies coupled with robust back-end tools. With usage reaching ~1M users, the Great American DineOut mapping tool maintained 100% reliability throughout the event.</p>

				<h2>Partner Recognition</h2>
				<p>Sponsors want to help and they want current and future customers to know about it. By identifying participating restaurants on the map tool, providing specific details about what they're doing to support the campaign, and including links to their websites, sponsors get top billing and the kudos they deserve. DineOut's interactive map is a great vehicle for sponsorship opportunities while supporting the cause.</p>

				<h2>Realtime Statistics</h2>
				<p>Saforian leveraged Google's V3 mapping technology to ensure consistent support for all major smart phones and browsers. Core capabilities were extended to provide custom map controls, markers, interactive sidebar and information windows. This technology allowed users to get real-time statistics for participating restaurants.</p>
