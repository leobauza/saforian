				<p>Each year, Share Our Strength's Great American DineOut event supports the No Kid Hungry campaign with a nationwide fundraising effort to end childhood hunger in America. Strength turned to us to create a system to help them manage the thousands of participating restaurants as well as a way for people nationwide to find information about sponsors, locations, and how to participate in this food-focused fundraiser in their own communities.</p>

				<p>We designed and developed a customized mapping application, based on <strong>Google Maps</strong> that presented geographical information about the actual sponsors participating in the fundraiser. The map gives site visitors the ability to search and discover participating restaurants in their local area. To foster <strong>audience engagement,</strong> visitors can RSVP via <strong>Facebook,</strong> view restaurants’ <strong>Twitter</strong> streams, or make reservations—all without leaving the app. </p>

				<p>We enhanced performance and reliability through the use of the latest <strong>HTML5, jQuery, jQuery Mobile,</strong> and <strong>Google V3</strong> Map front-end technologies coupled with robust back-end tools. With usage reaching <strong>~1M users,</strong> the Great American DineOut mapping tool maintained <strong>100% reliability</strong> throughout the event.</p>

				<h2>Partner Recognition</h2>
				<p>Giving sponsors a way to support the No Kid Hungry cause by having their establishment discoverable was one of the most important parts of the initiative. By identifying participating restaurants on the map tool, providing specific details about what they're doing to support the campaign, and including links to their websites, supporters are able to discover and <strong>engage</strong> with partners directly.</p>

				<h2>Realtime Statistics</h2>
				<p>The custom back-end administration app allowed Strength’s internal staff to monitor and report on actual activity in real time. Participation details can now be viewed and analyzed more efficiently, significantly reducing overhead costs and allowing Strength to funnel more of the donation funds towards the cause itself.</p>

				<h2>Data Visualization</h2>
				<p>With all of the restaurant and activity data being stored in a central location it allowed more accurate reporting as well as improved internal staff workflows. The system provides staff members instant details regarding the status of a restaurant and where there might be issues proactively.</p>

				<h2>Custom Mapping</h2>
				<p>We customized the mapping tool to individual users to make it easy for them to find a restaurant that satisfies their cravings as well as their desire to support a great cause. To find participating restaurants, users simply enter in their zip code and then filter results by radius, category, cuisine, and restaurant.</p>

				<h2>Custom Administration</h2>
				<p>To bring everything together, we created and built several integral pieces to help Strength establish a unified voice across the campaign. This included a custom backend database tool to manage restaurant data and statistics, dedicated mapping experiences for restaurant and sponsorship discovery, and optimized mobile experiences to improve engagement and overall participation.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Streamlining Strength’s management processes and removing the requirement of using Excel spreadsheets have allowed everyone involved to see the immediate benefits of having the data centralized in one system. The advantages of the new system were also immediately felt with Share Our Strengths supporters. Participants could RSVP directly via the map's integration with <strong>Facebook</strong> or <strong>Open Table.</strong> This led to <strong>35.8 million impressions</strong> and over <strong>5.2 million followers</strong> reached. Overall, the month long campaign led to over <strong>$5 million</strong> in support funds for the No Kid Hungry cause.</p>
