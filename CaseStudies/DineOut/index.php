				<p>Each year, Share Our Strength's Great American DineOut event supports the No Kid Hungry campaign with a nationwide fundraising effort to end childhood hunger in America. Strength turned to us to create a system to help them manage the thousands of participating restaurants as well as a way for people nationwide to find information about sponsors, locations, and how to participate in this food-focused fundraiser in their own communities.</p>

				<p>We designed and developed a customized mapping application, based on <strong>Google Maps</strong> that presented geographical information about the actual sponsors participating in the fundraiser. The nationwide map gives site visitors the ability to search and discover participating restaurants in their local area. From there, visitors can RSVP via Facebook, view restaurants’ Twitter streams, or make reservations—all without leaving the map.</p>

				<p>We enhanced performance and reliability through the use of the latest HTML5, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, and Google V3 Map front-end technologies coupled with robust back-end tools. With usage reaching <strong>~1M users,</strong> the Great American DineOut mapping tool maintained <strong>100% reliability</strong> throughout the event.</p>

				<h2>Partner Recognition</h2>
				<p>Giving sponsors a way to support the No Kid Hungry cause while also having their establishment discoverable was one of the most important parts of the initiative. By identifying participating restaurants on the map tool, providing specific details about what they're doing to support the campaign, and including links to their websites, sponsors get top billing and the kudos they deserve.</p>

				<h2>Realtime Statistics</h2>
				<p>The custom back-end administration app allowed Strength’s internal staff to monitor and report on actual activity in real time. Participation details can now be viewed and analyzed more efficiently, significantly reducing overhead costs allowing Strength to place more funds towards the cause itself.</p>

				<h2>Data Visualization</h2>
				<p>With all of the restaurant and activity data being stored in a central location it allowed more accurate reporting as well as improved workflows. The system provides staff members instant details regarding the status of a restaurant and where there might be issues proactively.</p>

						<p>We customized the mapping tool to individual users to make it easy for them to find a restaurant that satisfies their cravings as well as their desire to support a great cause. To find participating restaurants, users simply enter in their zip code and then filter results by radius, category, cuisine, and restaurant.</p>

				<h2>Admin Roles and Permissions</h2>
				<p>We created and built several integral pieces to help Strength establish a unified voice across campaigns, including a custom backend database tool to manage restaurant data and statistics as well as dedicated mapping experiences for the desktop and mobile platforms. Streamlining Strength’s management processes and removing the requirement of using Excel spreadsheets have allowed everyone involved to see the immediate benefits of having the data centralized in one system. The advantages of the new system were also immediately felt with Strength supporters. Participants could RSVP directly via the map's integration with Facebook or Open Table. This led to <strong>35.8 million impressions</strong> and over <strong>5.2 million followers</strong> reached. Overall, the month long campaign led to over <strong>$5 million</strong> for No Kid Hungry.</p>
