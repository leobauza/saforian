				<p>AAO sought out Saforian to transform their web presence and create an improved user experience that enabled members to find valuable content more quickly, explore new opportunities, engage with other members, and interact effortlessly with everyday tasks. We guided AAO to a rebuild with emphasis on establishing a digital strategy that supports user experience, engagement, aesthetics, retention and content management. Before the redesign, it was challenging to locate information on AAO’s website and multiple log-ins during a session resulted in a poor user experience. We improved search functions to allow members to find key information easily and integrated everything into a single login system. Our content strategists worked with AAO to strategically optimize content throughout and eliminate redundant, outdated pieces.</p>

				<h2>Informational Architecture</h2>
				<p>During our functional design activity we created an optimized organizational structure that provided better groupings to the content and feature sets throughout. We then made deep dives into formulating the required page-level content hierarchies and functionality needed to support the site’s overall requirements and to minimize any unnecessary steps for members and other audience groups along their journey’s through the site.
					<br/><br/>
					We created wireframe prototypes were to communicate the site’s information architecture and test potential solutions to page-level and section-level challenges. Using our defined audience goals and objectives, we incorporated refinements, paving the way for streamlined pathways and optimized navigational controls.</p>
					<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
					<h2>Navigational Models</h2>
					<p>We developed various navigation models that established hierarchical categories that center around the core of member activity and AAO’s offerings.
					To enable AAO to make appropriate connections across a single piece of content, we ensured that the navigational models, organic groups, and content all link to each other. For example, users can tag a news article to also appear in different sub-organization groups.</p>

				<h2>Drupal as a CMS</h2>
				<p>To minimize up-front costs and maintenance overhead, we took existing Drupal modules and built onto them to fulfill the majority of AAO’s needs. We built custom module components that provided the heavy lifting for areas that required deeper integration with other existing system. As with other Drupal projects, we believe the value of open source technologies is to leverage existing work, whether its work we have done on previous projects or work done by the vast Drupal community, to reduce project risk and on-going maintenance efforts.</p>

				<h2>Twitter Bootstrap with Drupal</h2>
				<p>Through tight integration with Twitter Bootstrap, we were able to meet responsive and UI needs more efficiently, in addition to eliminating jQuery conflicts that are known in Drupal 7.</p>

				<h2>Community</h2>
				<p>We developed My AAO to support AAO’s goal of engaging members with functionality that allows users to contribute content and share ideas both publicly and privately. Members can easily discuss industry wide topics and comment on news articles, site content, and events. Also, members have the ability to participate directly with AAO’s Twitter social network activity.</p>

				<h2>Responsive Design</h2>
				<p>When it comes to supporting mobile and emerging platforms, it is crucial that any site we build contains responsive design techniques. To cater to AAO’s audience of busy orthodontists, we designed the visual design and templates to be adaptable to mobile and tablet devices in addition to regular desktop computers and TVs.</p>

				<h2>Capturing + Connecting Audiences</h2>
				<p>My AAO, we created a dashboard experience to allow users to get a quick glance at where they are currently and where they should be going. For example, it displays registered events and other events members might be interested in and the current number of CE credits with opportunities to increase them. We focused on developing a platform to feature events in a more appealing way while minimizing the use of PDFs and integrating more efficiently with Netforum. The dashboard experience is a collaboration of member benefits and resources that makes it easy for members to navigate the site. Additionally, we developed a clear member segmentation of benefits to make it simple to differentiate between the various processes.</p>
