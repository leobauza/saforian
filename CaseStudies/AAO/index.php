				<p>AAO sought out Saforian to transform their web presence and create an improved user experience that enabled members to find valuable content more quickly, explore new opportunities, engage with other members, and interact effortlessly with everyday tasks. We guided AAO to a rebuild with emphasis on establishing a digital strategy that supports improved access capabilities, member engagement, audience conversion, retention and ongoing revenue generation.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>This was accomplished by leveraging enhanced searching functionality and integrating diverse back-end systems to utilize a single sign-on approach. The outcome is a platform that supports an improved member experience and a foundation for continued evolution.</p>

				<h2>Information Architecture</h2>
				<p>During our functional design activity we created an optimized organizational structure that provides better groupings to the content and feature sets throughout. We then made deep dives into formulating the required page-level content hierarchies and functionality needed to support the site’s overall requirements and to minimize any unnecessary steps for members and other audience groups along their journeys through the site.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>We created wireframe prototypes to communicate the site’s information architecture and test potential solutions to page-level and section-level challenges. Using our defined audience goals and objectives, we incorporated refinements, paving the way for streamlined pathways and optimized navigational controls.</p>
					<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
					<h2>Navigational Models</h2>
					<p>We developed various navigation models that establish hierarchical categories that center around the core of member activity and AAO’s offerings. To enable AAO to make appropriate connections across a single piece of content, we ensured that the navigational models, organic groups, and content all link to each other. For example, users can tag a news article or other valuable content pieces to also appear in different sub-organization group sections.</p>

				<h2>Content Management Using Drupal</h2>
				<p>To minimize up-front costs and maintenance overhead, we took existing Drupal modules and built onto them to fulfill the majority of AAO’s needs. We built custom module components that provide the heavy lifting for areas that required deeper integration with other existing systems.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>As with other Drupal projects, we believe the value of open source technologies is to leverage existing work, whether it’s work we have done on previous projects or work done by the vast Drupal community, to reduce project risk and ongoing maintenance efforts.</p>

				<h2>Single Sign On</h2>
				<p>Effectively integrating multiple CRM systems can make a major impact on the user experience. Our developers created a seamless integration with NetForum and a Single Sign On with three different systems. To integrate the header and footer from the Drupal site to the NetForum site, we adjusted the existing CSS and Javascript so that it would work in the new environment. We were able to pull event information from NetForum and push AJO-DO results back to NetForum.</p>

				<h2>Community</h2>
				<p>To support AAO’s goal of improving engagement with members we developed My AAO. It includes functionality that allows members to contribute content and share ideas both publicly and privately. Members can easily discuss industry-wide topics and comment on news articles, site content, and events. Also, members can participate in the greater conversation by interacting directly with AAO’s Twitter social network activity.</p>

				<h2>Responsive Design</h2>
				<p>When it comes to supporting mobile and emerging platforms, it is crucial that any site we build contains responsive design techniques. To cater to AAO’s audience of busy orthodontists, we designed the visual design and templates to be adaptable to mobile and tablet devices in addition to regular desktop computers and other emerging platforms.</p>

				<h2>Personalized Member Experience</h2>
				<p>Using an improved Drupal content management system, we made content work more efficiently throughout, all the while giving AAO more opportunities to easily distribute content in ways members want.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>The result of these efforts is the ability to provide a personalized member experience that can be tailored to work on tablets and other mobile devices. This personalized experience gives members the ability to get a quick glance at where they are currently in their membership and where they should be going. For example, it displays registered events and other events members might be interested in and the current number of <strong>Continuing Education</strong> credits with opportunities to increase them. Our focus is on developing a platform to feature personalized access to key content and member engagement capabilities from wherever they are and whenever they want.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Stay tuned for more information about our personalized member experience efforts that leverages today’s tablet and mobile devices while providing the foundation for supporting additional emerging platforms as they become available.</p>
