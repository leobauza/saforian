				<p>AAs the largest international public health & development organization, FHI 360 reached out to us to provide a digital solution to meet their online goals. The old website was difficult to update and did not convey the breadth of FHI’s work and the evolution of the organization. FHI 360 originally had over a dozen different website properties that all contained various bits of information regarding their services and practice areas. 
					<br/><br/>
					We redesigned the website to better suit FHI’s objectives and organized and consolidated over 10,000+ content pages and external documents into one easy-to-use website. The new site provides an optimized organizational structure that simplifies access to key information and communicates FHI’s mission and the solutions they bring to the table to address today’s interrelated development challenges.</p>

				<h2>Informational Architecture</h2>
				<p>For the site’s information architecture, our interactive engineers first gathered requirements regarding FHI 360’s diverse audience groups and outreach plans. We then developed various organizational and content maps that allowed us to test different approaches. This was further enhanced by creating variations on the navigational models so that we could test labeling, relationship between sections, taxonomy, and flow in order to deliver an incredible user experience.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Once we finalized an organizational structure, we moved forward with creating various navigational models and extensive wireframing to outline the various page-level requirements for the rest of the site.</p>

						<h2>International</h2>
						<p>To accommodate FHI’s diverse worldwide audience, we took into consideration slow internet speeds and used responsive design. Our goal was to bring FHI’s international work to life and communicate their global impact on public health. We equipped regional and country offices with the ability to highlight their work and create an online presence to distinguish FHI from competitors.</p>

						<h2>Responsive Design</h2>
						<p>We used responsive design to ensure content is accessible across a variety of platforms to accommodate FHI’s diverse international audience. We coded the site to efficiently communicate the breadth and diversity of FHI’s work and data with the ability to translate to a variety of languages. Our goal was to provide a content-rich site without overwhelming the user and design for both the quick skimmer and the in-depth researcher.</p>

				<h2>Drupal Out of the Box</h2>
				<p>To reduce time and to support some of the desired functionality, we utilized existing Drupal modules and tailored them to FHI’s objectives. We used our pre-defined configuration of site features and functions for a responsive base theme and created custom Drupal modules to help support the complexity of this project.</p>
