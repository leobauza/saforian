				<p>As the largest international public health & development organization, FHI 360 reached out to us to provide a digital solution to meet their online goals. The old website was difficult to update and did not convey the breadth of FHI’s work and the evolution of the organization.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>We redesigned the website to better suit FHI’s objectives and organizational needs. This consisted of consolidating and organizing over <strong>10,000+ content pages</strong> and external documents into one easy-to-use website. The new site provides an optimized organizational structure that simplifies access to key information and communicates FHI’s mission and the solutions they bring to the table to address today’s interrelated development challenges.</p>

				<h2>Informational Architecture</h2>
				<p>For the site’s information architecture, our interactive engineers first gathered requirements regarding FHI 360’s diverse audience groups and outreach plans. We then developed various organizational and content maps that allowed us to test different approaches. This was further enhanced by creating variations on the navigational models so that we could test labeling, relationships between sections, taxonomy, and flow in order to deliver an effective way-finding system.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Once we finalized a new organizational structure, we moved forward with creating various navigational models and extensive wireframing to outline the various page-level requirements for the rest of the site.</p>

				<h2>Flexible Content Management</h2>
				<p>To meet the demanding needs of FHI 360’s researchers and experts, we used Drupal as the CMS of choice. Drupal allowed us to build in an elaborate taxonomy and underlining administration system that gives content context, while also providing support for relationships to tie the entire story together. Utilizing existing Drupal modules where available and tailoring them to meet FHI 360’s objectives, we were able to reduce complexities and ongoing maintenance needs.</p>

				<h2>International</h2>
				<p>To accommodate FHI’s diverse worldwide audience, we took into consideration slow internet speeds and used responsive design. Our goal was to bring FHI’s international work to life and communicate their global impact on public health. We equipped regional and country portions of the site to provide the ability to highlight the work and expertise that is occurring at the local level. This will continually be enhanced with the introduction of specialized country tools to foster localized mobilization efforts.</p>

				<h2>Responsive Design</h2>
				<p>Using responsive design techniques we were able to ensure content is accessible across a variety of platforms and screen dimensions. We streamlined the site's code to efficiently present the breadth and diversity of FHI’s work and data while also supporting the ability for the entire site to be translated in a variety of languages.</p>
