				<p>As the largest international public health & development organization, FHI 360 reached out to us to provide a digital solution to meet their goals. The old website was difficult to update and did not convey the breadth of FHI’s work. FHI originally had over a dozen websites for each of their projects. We redesigned the website to better suit FHI’s objectives and organized and consolidated over 1,000 documents into one easy-to-use website. We created an organizational structure that simplified access to key information and communicated FHI’s mission and the solutions they bring to the table to solve the world health crisis.</p>

				<h2>Informational Architecture</h2>
				<p>To create an effective information architecture for FHI, our interactive engineers first gathered requirements in order to meet FHI’s specifications. Then we developed an organizational content map and site map. Next, we developed a navigational structure, completed extensive wireframing, and created a database design that was delivered as an entity relationship diagram. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				We created navigational models to test ideas on how users should navigate the organizational structure. Then we created variations on the navigational models so we could test labeling, relationship between sections, taxonomy, and flow in order to deliver an incredible user experience.</p>

						<h2>International</h2>
						<p>To accommodate FHI’s diverse worldwide audience, we took into consideration slow internet speeds and used responsive design. Our goal was to bring FHI’s international work to life and communicate their global impact on public health. We equipped regional and country offices with the ability to highlight their work and create an online presence to distinguish FHI from competitors.</p>

						<h2>Responsive Design</h2>
						<p>We used responsive design to ensure content is accessible across a variety of platforms to accommodate FHI’s diverse international audience. We coded the site to efficiently communicate the breadth and diversity of FHI’s work and data with the ability to translate to a variety of languages. Our goal was to provide a content-rich site without overwhelming the user and design for both the quick skimmer and the in-depth researcher.</p>

				<h2>Custom Drupal Modules</h2>
				<p>To limit additional costs, we reconfigured existing Drupal modules and tailored them to FHI’s objectives. We used our pre-defined configuration of site features and functions for a base theme and created custom Drupal modules to help support the complexity of this project.</p>
