				<p>Wagner, a luxe ski designer and manufacturer, asked Saforian to refresh the digital presence for Wagnerskis.com with the goal of driving online sales. We started by developing a fresh brand identity that captured the spirit of this high-end company across all of its products and media. Using the brand as our foundation for everything, we created a digital experience to build brand loyalty and create insightful campaigns. Using visually stunning graphics and customized traffic generators, we crafted an engaging digital experience that <strong>increased online sales by 90% and site visits from 3,582 to 120,049 (3,251%)</strong> over a 4 year period. From a “Design Your Own Skis” contest and an opportunity to win a luxury ski vacation, our savvy social media experts made it possible for Wagner to have ongoing conversations with customers and the ski community.</p>

				<h2>Wagner Logo</h2>
				<p>Think simple. Think impactful and step into the Wagner brand. A custom brand needs a custom logo mark. Saforian was privileged to provide Wagner with a custom logo mark that has become the synonymous calling card for the Wagner Custom Skis brand.</p>

				<h2>Revenue Generation</h2>
				<p>Because the shopping experience isn’t exactly like your average e-commerce experience in which you select an item, pay for it, and pick it up in a day or two on your doorstep, we developed a custom Zencart based ecommerce system. This system facilitates the addition of custom skis into visitors’ shopping carts and manages the procurement and payment processes.</p>

				<h2>Database Integration</h2>
				<p>We worked closely with Wagner to define the required integration points into Wagner’s proprietary Skier DNA backend manufacturing system. Details regarding a buyers skiing preferences get collected and transformed into milling specs that then in-turn result in the perfect pair of skis.</p>

				<h2>Responsive Design</h2>
				<p>To accommodate Wagner’s diverse audience, we created an experience that is accessible across a variety of platforms. Whether you prefer to use an iPad, iPhone, computer, or TV, the experience is responsively refined to work seamlessly for each device and medium.</p>

				<h2>Interactive Data Collection Tool</h2>
				<p>Since most Wagner Skis are custom made to order, you can’t go into a store and buy a pair that has been individually made for you. So to help retailers get potential ski junkies interested in the Wagner DNA custom design process we made an iPad app. The app is based on Wagner’s proprietary Skier DNA system and presents potential buyers with questions about their terrain preferences, ski experience, binding options, and body composition that allow Wagner to collect the data necessary for creating individualized skis.</p>
