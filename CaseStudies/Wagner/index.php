				<p>Wagner, a luxe ski designer and manufacturer, asked Saforian to refresh the digital presence for Wagnerskis.com with the goal of driving online sales. We started by developing a fresh brand identity that captured the spirit of this high-end company across all of its products and media. Using the brand as our foundation for everything, we created a digital experience to enhance the brand and create campaigns. Using visually stunning graphics and customized traffic generators, Saforian crafted an engaging digital experience that increased online sales by 90% and site visits from 3,582 to 120,049 (3,251%) over a 4 year period. From a “Design Your Own Skis” contest and an opportunity to win a luxury ski vacation, our savvy social media experts made it possible for Wagner to have ongoing conversations with customers and the ski community.</p>

				<h2>Expert HTML + CSS</h2>
				<p>Our coding pros used custom HTML, CSS, and Javascript code to develop a unique digital experience for Wagnerskis.com. We created a full screen viewable site that resizes to any browser or device. We made it gesture-controlled to complement the iPad medium. This all ties to the framework of 500,000 lines of code to get you your perfect set of custom skis.</p>

				<h2>Interactive Data Collection Tool</h2>
				<p>Since most Wagner Skis are custom made to order, you can’t go into a store and buy the models made individually for you. So we made an iPad app to capture customers’ attention when they are buzzing around the store and to begin the sales process for Wagner. We created a custom DNA app that allows Wagner to collect the data necessary for creating individualized skis. The interactive app makes it easy for users to design their perfect set of skis by answering questions about their terrain preferences, ski experience, binding options, and body composition.</p>
