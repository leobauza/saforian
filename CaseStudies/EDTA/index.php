				<p>As a holding company, Qivliq supports a diverse family of enterprises that conduct operations spanning the spectrum from national security logistics contracting to healthcare facilities management. Qivliq sought out Saforian to transform their web presence to reach their target audience groups of federal agency workers, strategic partners, and employees. They also needed new branding to clarify who Qivliq is and why they exist.</p>

				<h2>Drupal Integration</h2>
				<p>We developed custom Drupal code to communicate with EdTA's proprietary CRM system and pass site members from the Drupal website content to CRM content as needed. Drupal provided the flexibility needed to support the specific publishing requirements as well providing a robust authoring platform that could grow with EdTA's needs.</p>

				<h2>Navigational Models</h2>
				<p>We developed the site using WordPress to make it easy for administrators to update and modify content without programming knowledge. The jQuery-enhanced site draws a clear correlation between Qivliq’s dedication to their clients’ success, the HR and management support they provide to their member companies, and the sustaining dividends they pay to their shareholders.</p>

				<h2>Audience Analysis</h2>
				<p>We performed ethnographic studies in the field to get a better understanding of EdTA's target audience groups. To define the site’s new user experience goals, we analyzed participants’ backgrounds and experiences along with their emotional and informational needs. We asked students and teachers specific questions about thespian programs as well as how EdTA enhanced their experiences in the thespian community.</p>

				<h2>Information Architecture</h2>
				<p>To create an incredible user experience tailored to EdTA’s target audiences, we conducted in-person interviews to get to know theatre educators and students in order to address the needs of real users. These interviews formed the foundation of the new information architecture and guided the selection of required functionality.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>We created an optimized organizational structure that provides better groupings to the content and feature sets throughout. We then made deep dives into formulating the required page-level content hierarchies and functionality needed to support the site’s overall requirements and to minimize any unnecessary steps for members and other audience groups along their journeys through the site.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>We created wireframe prototypes to communicate the site’s information architecture and to test potential solutions to page-level and section-level challenges. Using our defined audience goals and objectives, we incorporated refinements, paving the way for streamlined pathways and optimized navigational controls.</p>
