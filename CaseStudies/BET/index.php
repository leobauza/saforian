				<p>Black Entertainment Television (BET) is the leading provider of media and entertainment for African Americans and consumers of African American culture, reaching over 90 million households in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the Middle East, and the Caribbean. The <strong>BET Awards</strong> and <strong>BET Hip Hop Awards</strong> are the media giant’s prestigious awards shows, honoring artistic contributions to the African American community and the world at large. We were invited to work with BET in defining the functionality of secure voting websites for each set of awards. We worked with BET staff to define and analyze the detailed requirements and functionality specifications for each of the voting sites. Our goal was to simplify the voting process across a variety of platforms and give participants an incredible user experience.</p>
