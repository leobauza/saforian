				<p>Rider University is a private, coeducational university located on 280 beautiful acres on two campuses in New Jersey. Founded in 1865, it has evolved into a diverse, comprehensive university with vibrant and expansive programs in the arts, sciences, and education. We were approached by Rider University to create a digital solution to drive interest and enrollment. Our goal was to create an interactive virtual tour of Rider to guide prospective students through campus.</p>

				<h2>Interactive Storytelling</h2>
				<p>Our goal was to develop an effortless interactive experience to communicate Rider’s story to prospective students. We wanted to showcase all Rider has to offer and give prospective students a true sense of what it’s like at the university from the dorms, dining halls, athletic events, and student life.</p>

				<h2>Responsive Design</h2>
				<p>With students on a range of devices in the course of a day we wanted to make sure they could have a fluid site experience no matter how the tour was accessed. We designed the virtual tour to be adaptable to mobile and tablet devices as well as laptops and other emerging platforms.</p>

				<h2>Interactive Experience</h2>
				<p>Campus visits are a crucial factor in a prospective student’s decision-making process, but it’s impossible for students to visit every school they are interested in. More universities are taking advantage of virtual tours to give wider access to their institutions and reach international students, and more families are turning to them in lieu of actual college visits to save time and money.</p>
