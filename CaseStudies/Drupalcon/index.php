		<h1>Drupalcon</h1>
		<article class="row-fluid">
			<div class="span6">
				<p>Many Drupal enthusiasts have traveled long distances to be at this year’s DrupalCon (aka the biggest Drupal conference). They’ve endured freakishly long car rides, plane rides with screaming babies, and train rides from hell to make it to Portland safe and sound. With that in mind, we wanted to create an app to make it easy for these weary travelers to maximize their DrupalCon experiences. If you use our app, you won’t be sitting around saying, “Well I don’t know… What do <em>you</em> wanna do?” We’ve researched, deliberated, and made some cut-throat decisions to compile our list of the best things to do in Portland. Our fun, interactive app lets you live it up at DrupalCon by showing you what’s going on at the conference and the hot spots to check out in Portland, along with making it easy to connect with other Drupal lovers.</p>

				<h2>Built on iOS</h2>
				<p>Unsurprisingly, our DrupalCon app is powered by Drupal. Our interactive engineers built this all-in-one immersive app to work seamlessly on iOS devices. It transfers data from the Drupal framework to our custom app’s framework, making it easy to get the full DrupalCon experience on the go.</p>

				<h2>Telling a Story</h2>
				<p>When we think of Portland, we think about the vibrant Portland culture, the renowned culinary scene, the hordes of breweries, and the oodles of outdoorsy activities. Our app caters to the Portland culture and tells a creative story. To bring the app’s characters to life, we paired vivacious illustrations with an original backstory to give them personality and flair.</p>

				<h2>Capturing Data</h2>
				<p>Our app pulls data from the DrupalCon Portland site to access conference info like speakers, room numbers, and course level of difficulty. We enabled push notifications so you'll be in the loop if something changes at the last minute. The app also pulls data from Twitter to give you up to the minute DrupalCon updates.</p>

				<h2>Interactive Elements</h2>
				<p>Our engineers took a user-centered approach and focused on functionality, user input, content, and layout. Our goal was to make this app engaging and memorable by integrating interactive elements like gesture controls. The app gets the audience involved and features animations like punching the bear and spinning the tracks wheel.</p>

				<h2>A system that works</h2>
				<p>Fun, interactive, and engaging, our DrupalCon app is the perfect companion for DrupalCon attendees. With this app, you won’t be reliant on Wi-Fi to figure out what session to go to next or how much time you have in between. Our app displays the DrupalCon schedule along with the speaker, room number, and each session’s level of difficulty.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Our user interface experts went through many phases to ensure that the experience is uniform across every category. It’s clean, organized, and easy to navigate. Every detail page has the same structure and feel.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>More than anything, we wanted our app to be memorable. We didn’t want to create a boring app just listing the DrupalCon schedule. Feeling spontaneous? Give our track wheel a spin. Our interactive engineers built a wheel selector with a filter system to show the 9 color coded DrupalCon tracks. The app’s sorting functionality gives you the option to select by date, by track, or to spin the wheel.</p>

				<h2>Design meets function</h2>
				<p>Explore Portland the easy way. Choose from 7 different categories—food, coffee, breweries, biking, hiking, gardens, and film. Let’s say you tap breweries. You are then taken to a page listing all of the Portland breweries we have selected. Then, say you pick BridgePort Brewing Company. You are then taken to a page with a quick description of BridgePort along with their address, phone number, website, and map. A few taps later and your brewery tour is planned and beervana is moments away.</p>

				<h2>All in the details</h2>
				<p>Our app is fun, it’s quirky, and it’s got personality. By now, you may be wondering, why is a lumberjack punching a bear? Our content strategist dreamt up a backstory for the app’s 3 main characters and promoted the campaign across social media. Here’s a glimpse. Clyde is the socially awkward lumberjack who has been living alone in the Oregon mountains ever since he was abandoned on a school field trip at age 10. Remington is the womanizing grizzly bear who loves gourmet cooking. And finally, Emma, the beautiful Drupal wiz who has charmed the pants off Remy and Clyde and ended their close friendship.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Accompany Clyde on his first trip out of the woods since he was 10 as he explores Portland and DrupalCon to try to find the girl of his dreams, Emma. Don’t forget keep an eye out for Remy and Clyde passing out swag once you get to DrupalCon.</p>

				<h2>Location-based Services</h2>
				<p>Once you have found some cool places you want to check out, our app will get you there. Our app pinpoints your exact location to help you find nearby coffee shops, restaurants, and other featured attractions. It pulls information from cellular, wi-fi, and GPS to determine your location.</p>
