				<p>As one of the leading nonprofit organizations in affordable housing and community development, NeighborWorks America works to create opportunities for lower-income people to live in affordable homes in safe, sustainable neighborhoods. NeighborWorks approached us to jumpstart their Multicultural Women Homeownership Marketing Campaign. We created a successful marketing toolkit to encourage and inspire NeighborWorks’ target audience of multicultural women to become homeowners and raise awareness of available resources and services.</p>

				<h2>Campaign Strategy</h2>
				<p>Revolving around NeighborWorks’ goal of empowering multicultural women to become homeowners, our strategy was to develop expressive content and impactful visuals to inspire their target audience. Our marketing strategy was location-based and focused on when and where to hit certain areas and demographics to maximize results.</p>

				<h2>Placement</h2>
				<p>Working within NeighborWorks’ budget, we determined the best locations to place the marketing messages. We used a myriad of marketing techniques including traditional marketing venues like door-placement, radio and TV PSAs, billboards, and fliers. The toolkit was distributed to housing industry professionals to provide them with resources and support needed to notify multicultural women of available programs and resources.</p>

				<h2>Message</h2>
				<p>Based off focus study results, the campaign messaging reflected the following concepts: family, pride, and process. The messaging was specifically designed to facilitate the homeownership process for women and promote available programs and services. It focused on giving women a sense of financial independence and achievement while addressing the concerns of single mothers who often want to buy a home to create family stability.</p>
