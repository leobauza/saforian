				<p>Specializing in renovations, restorations, and modernizations of occupied large government and commercial buildings and facilities, Grunley reached out to us to develop a digital strategy to jumpstart their expansion into new markets and help tell the Grunley story more effectively.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>We developed the site using responsive design to ensure content is flexible to the space you are viewing it in. Our content strategists condensed lengthy, wordy blocks of text into concise, easily digestible pieces to improve content consumption and scan-ability. To support ongoing upkeep and content changes, we developed the site within Drupal’s CMS environment. We tailored the CMS to meet Grunley’s specific needs and allow for a streamlined publishing workflow.</p>

				<h2>Navigational Models</h2>
				<p>To improve the user experience, we created navigational models to make the site easy to navigate. We streamlined the main sections of the site to provide better groupings of content and created drop down menus to give audiences the ability to jump to tertiary pages more efficiently.</p>

				<h2>Content Management</h2>
				<p>The Drupal CMS was chosen for its flexibility and growth potential. We started with available modules and tailored areas to fit specific project requirements. From there, we configured a taxonomy to provide dynamic filtering capabilities based on tags. The foundation put in place will allow for continued future growth as Grunley’s needs evolve over time.</p>

				<h2>Photography</h2>
				<p>Choosing the right photos makes all the difference. We took advantage of custom photography to create an artistic direction for Grunley’s site. The result? Stunning visuals that showcase Grunley’s projects while supporting the aesthetic direction of the site.</p>

				<h2>Navigation</h2>
				<p>Giving audiences an easy and effective way to discover the content areas within a site is always the number one priority. To accomplish this, we built a dedicated Drupal module. This module supports customizable elements like image, text, and videos and ties in with Drupal’s existing menu system for easy updating.</p>

				<h2>Responsive</h2>
				<p>To accommodate Grunley’s diverse audience, we built the site using responsive design to adapt to different devices. Whether you access the site on a tablet, phone, laptop, desktop computer, or TV, we ensured that the content works the same across all devices and platforms.</p>
