			<div class="span6">
				<p>As a non-profit research organization operating the Center for Naval Analyses and the Institute for Public Research, CNA is a pioneer in the field of operations research and analysis. CNA faced a distinct challenge in organizing the vast amount of information they collect into a meaningful source to help public-sector organizations develop sound policies, make better-informed decisions, and manage programs more efficiently. They turned to us for a digital solution to improve their organizational design and information architecture.</p>

				<h2>Informational Architecture</h2>
				<p>For the site’s information architecture, our interactive engineers first gathered requirements regarding CNA’s diverse audience groups and policies. We then developed various organizational and content maps that allowed us to test different approaches. This was further enhanced by creating variations on the navigational models so that we could test labeling, relationships between sections, taxonomy, and flow in order to deliver an effective way-finding system.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Once we finalized a new organizational structure, we moved forward with creating various navigational models and extensive wireframing to outline the various page-level requirements for the rest of the site.</p>

				<h2>Drupal Integration</h2>
				<p>CNA also needed a simple, straightforward means for updating the website. As such, we integrated the CNA site with the Drupal content management system to allows any user, regardless of their level of technical expertise, to easily and quickly update any page on the website. Utilizing existing Drupal modules where available and tailoring them to meet CNA's objectives, we were able to reduce complexities and ongoing maintenance needs.</p>

				<h2>Navigational Models</h2>
				<p>To improve the user experience, we created navigational models to make the site easy to navigate. We streamlined the main sections of the site to provide better groupings of content and created drop down menus to give audiences the ability to jump to tertiary pages more efficiently.</p>
