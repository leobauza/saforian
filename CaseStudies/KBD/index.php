		<h1>Kick Butts Day</h1>
		<article class="row-fluid">
			<div class="span6">
				<p>A campaign by Tobacco Free Kids, Kick Butts Day is a day of activism that empowers youth to stand up and speak out against Big Tobacco. The campaign revolves around youth advocates getting involved in their local schools to put on an activity to spread the anti-smoking message to their peers and generating donations for anti-smoking efforts.
				<br/><br/>
				TFK came to us to jumpstart their 2013 campaign and to reach their target audience of youth advocates more effectively. We redesigned their site and logo to give it a fresh look and feel. With the goal of making it easy and fun for the youth to understand how to get involved and why it is important, we upgraded their content by refreshing their voice and style.</p>

						<h2>Navigational Models</h2>
						<p>We worked closely with TFK to determine how the content should be organized, labeled, and categorized. TFK provided materials describing the content and their overall desires on how the site should be organized and we vetted these materials and provided some enhancements based on best practices and prior knowledge of the program.</p>

						<h2>Stats</h2>
						<p>We helped TFK reach more youth advocates than the previous Kick Butts Day and increased donation amounts. To track the campaign’s effectiveness, staff can access our custom back-end administration tools to see real time activity and overall participation. Combined with Google Analytics for site monitoring, TFK’s staff can quickly analyze how effective their outreach initiatives are performing and make adjustments where needed.</p>

				<h2>CodeIgniter & ExpressionEngine</h2>
				<p>To allow TFK to  manage the campaign more effectively, we built a custom backend administration tool using the wonderful CodeIgniter PHP framework from EllisLabs. The administration capabilities allowed TFK staff to easily and quickly see where all participants were in the campaign’s workflow.</p>

				<h2>Backend Administration</h2>
				<p>The public facing site was then built using EllisLabs ExpressionEngine CMS system. This allowed the staff to manage the site’s public facing content and make updates quickly and efficiently without having to have in depth HTML knowledge. We integrated a mapping component into the site that shows where youth advocates are getting involved throughout the country, which helps motivate users to get involved and join the community effort.</p>
