				<p>Specialicious, a daily deals site from Northern Virginia Magazine, features exclusive specials for restaurants, shopping, and entertainment from local businesses. With the goal of boosting sales and increasing web and mobile traffic, Specialicious reached out to us to develop an innovative digital solution. Our goal was to rebuild their architecture to be more reusable and easier to maintain while making sure they hit their audience where they want to be reached and when they want to be reached. We added two iOS mobile applications: a merchant app to allow more automated real time redemption system and a more reliable end-user application. The four major tasks we performed were initial site maintenance activities, Merchant iOS App, End User iOS App for deploying Specialicious functionality, and specification development for Specialicious admin functionality changes.</p>

				<h2>Custom PHP</h2>
				<p>Our interactive engineers custom coded PHP modules to fit the goals of Specialicious. The major components include the customer website, merchant website, admin tools, merchant app interface module, and Specialicious app interface module. We migrated the customer and merchant sites from another PHP framework into the new CodeIgniter framework and developed the admin tools and app modules from scratch. To handle web-based transactions, we wrote custom code in the MVC framework which also serves as a back-end service for the mobile app.</p>

				<h2>Native iOS Modules</h2>
				<p>We developed an iOS app app similar to the functionality of Groupon and LivingSocial available in the Apple App store that allows users to view, purchase, and redeem specials. The app is personalized to each user and stores individuals’ profile information, purchases, special data and lists, and user account deals. The app lets users go green by alleviating the need to print out and present vouchers to merchants. We also developed a Merchant iOS app for Specialicious merchants to allow them to scan printed vouchers, input sales transaction costs, view redemption history, and verify voucher status.</p>
