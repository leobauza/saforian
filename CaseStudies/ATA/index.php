				<p>ATA came to us to revamp their digital presence and make it easy for members to access their extensive library of resources. We established a new organizational structure that streamlined access to content and provided a better member experience through a refined information architecture. Our coding experts used HTML and CSS to develop an effective, responsive design that enables faster page downloads. We also used SharePoint to leverage ATA’s existing publishing workflows and established a proactive plan for SharePoint Governance. We interfaced the site with ATA’s membership database, Personify, to present member information and activity.</p>

				<p>The success of a digital solution largely depends on the methodology used to develop and deliver it. For ATA, we leveraged their existing publishing workflows and an automated site provisioning solution to create a best-in-class site that grows as ATA grows.</p>

				<h2>Expert HTML + CSS</h2>
				<p>With an extensive amount of information to present, ATA needed a crisp, clean interface to give users the visual clues necessary to find desired information. Using HTML and CSS, we implemented an elegant, effective design that is responsive and enables faster page downloads.</p>

				<h2>Sharepoint Governance</h2>
				<p>The best way to manage a SharePoint site and keep it relevant for the long term is to create a governance plan. We worked with ATA to establish their own cross-functional board and to create a proactive plan for how employees interact with the new site.</p>

				<h2>Database Integration</h2>
				<p>We interfaced the new site with ATA's membership database, Personify. Through custom queries we presented member-specific information, including membership activity and subscriptions. We also queried Personify to display members-only data in a variety of dynamic blocks throughout the site.</p>

				<h2>Capturing + Connecting Audiences</h2>
				<p>To reach ATA’s target audiences, we conducted extensive research to establish a strong plan of action. Our content strategists surveyed and interviewed ATA members at conferences to develop a comprehensive understanding of their desires, needs, and objectives. With this audience analysis, we worked with ATA’s internal web team to structure the site to guide users to the information they wanted. ATA members can build a custom experience around personalization of events and meetings, news, CE credits, and webinars. To cater to ATA’s diverse audience of people on-the-go, we used responsive design to make the site accessible on tablets and mobile phones.</p>
