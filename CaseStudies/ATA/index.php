				<p>As the nation's largest trucking association, ATA came to us to revamp their digital presence and make it easy for their members to access the extensive library of content and resources. To do this, we developed a digital strategy that included focusing on improving access capabilities, enhancing engagement throughout, improving member conversion opportunities, and establishing better member retention and revenue generation capabilities. The end result? An enhanced member experience that streamlines access to key content and provides a foundation for future growth and content delivery. The road is now open!</p>

				<h2>Content Management</h2>
				<p>The success of a digital solution largely depends on the methodology used to develop and deliver it. For ATA, we leveraged their existing publishing workflows and an automated site provisioning solution to create a best-in-class site that grows as ATA grows.</p>

				<h2>Front-End Code</h2>
				<p>With an extensive amount of information to present, ATA needed a crisp, clean interface to give users the visual clues necessary to find desired information. Using HTML and CSS, we implemented an elegant, effective design that is responsive and enables faster page downloads.</p>

				<h2>SharePoint Governance</h2>
				<p>The best way to manage a SharePoint site and keep it relevant for the long term is to create a governance plan. We worked with ATA to establish their internal cross-functional board and to create a proactive plan for how employees interact with the new site.</p>

				<h2>AMS Integration</h2>
				<p>We interfaced the new site with ATA's membership database, Personify. Through custom queries, we presented member-specific information, including membership activity and subscription details. We also queried Personify to display member-only data in a variety of dynamic blocks throughout the site.</p>

				<h2>Capturing and Connecting Audiences</h2>
				<p>To reach ATA’s target audiences, we conducted extensive research to establish a strong plan of action. Our content strategists surveyed and interviewed ATA members at conferences to develop a comprehensive understanding of their desires, needs, and objectives. With this audience analysis, we worked with ATA’s internal team to structure a portal to guide users to the information they wanted. ATA members can build a custom experience around personalization of events and meetings, news, CE credits, and webinars.</p>
