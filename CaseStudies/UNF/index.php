		<h1>UN Clean Cookstoves</h1>

			<div class="span6">
				<p>With the ambitious mission of universal adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels, the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves needed a striking website to mobilize support from a wide range of private, public, and nonprofit stakeholders. Our goal for Clean Cookstoves’ website was to clearly communicate how the organization functions, how work is being done, and where work is being done, while also giving partners a community platform to collaborate and share ideas. We tailored our approach to fit Clean Cookstoves’ diverse international audience and created a interface working within the Convio platform to make it easy for users to access and sift through data about Clean Cookstoves in developing countries.</p>

				<h2>Informational Architecture</h2>
				<p>We compiled all of Clean Cookstoves’ resources into a searchable, user-friendly database to enhance the user experience. Users now have access to market assessments, consumer behavior and preference information, and resource studies. It is easy for users to find the information they need with the country or topic search function. The goal was to provide a structure that helps the audience identify the “why” behind what the cause is all about.</p>

				<h2>Outreach Support</h2>
				<p>We collaborated with our partner, the United Nations Foundation, to reach their target audience and connect users to valuable resources for the Clean Cookstove Campaign. Part of this endeavor involved the creation of online newsletters. This proved to be a true marketing business asset and allowed UNF to track successes. The newsletters direct readers back to the website where they can do further research, be part of the community, or take action.</p>
