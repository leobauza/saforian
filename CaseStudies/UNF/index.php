		<h1>UN Clean Cookstoves</h1>
		<article class="row-fluid">
			<div class="span6">
				<p>With the ambitious mission of universal adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels, the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves needed a striking website to mobilize support from a wide range of private, public, and nonprofit stakeholders. Our goal for Clean Cookstoves’ website was to clearly communicate how the organization functions, how work is being done, and where work is being done, while also giving partners a community platform to collaborate and share ideas. We tailored our approach to fit Clean Cookstoves’ diverse international audience and created a interface working within the Convio platform to make it easy for users to access and sift through data about Clean Cookstoves in the third world.</p>

				<h2>Informational Architecture</h2>
				<p>We compiled all of Clean Cookstoves’ useful resources into a searchable, user-friendly database to enhance the user experience. Users now have access to market assessments, consumer behavior and preference information, and resource studies. It is easy for users to find the information they need with country or topic search function. Using Convio’s Luminate CMS, we developed Clean Cookstoves’ knowledge database to allow administrators to update content frequently.</p>

				<h2>Custom Search</h2>
				<p>We improved search functionality by using a custom filtering mechanism built from a Rails module. Our goal was to make it easy for users to access specific statistical data regarding cookstoves technology and various demographic / socio-graphic information in different countries for analysis and comparison. The goal was to provide audiences with tools to help identify the “why” behind what the cause is all about. Also, it allows users to see the latest country-based information for helping to make judgement calls on which countries need the most help.</p>
