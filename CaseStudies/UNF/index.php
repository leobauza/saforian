		<h1>UN Clean Cookstoves</h1>
		<article class="row-fluid">
			<div class="span6">
				<p>With the ambitious mission of universal adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels, the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves needed a striking website to mobilize support from a wide range of private, public, and nonprofit stakeholders. Our goal for Clean Cookstoves’ website was to clearly communicate how the organization functions, how work is being done, and where work is being done, while also providing partners access to a community platform to collaborate and share ideas. We tailored our approach to fit Clean Cookstoves’ diverse international audience. Working within the Convio platform, we created an interface to make it easy for UNF admins to manage content while giving site audiences access to the key data about clean cookstoves needed in developing countries.</p>

				<h2>Information Architecture</h2>
				<p>With the goal of providing a site structure that helps audiences identify the “why” behind the cause, we compiled all of Clean Cookstoves’ resources into a searchable, user-friendly database. Site audiences now have access to market assessments, consumer behavior and preference information, and resource studies. It is easy for anyone to find the information they need using the country or topic search functionality.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Through extensive wireframe prototypes, we provided UNF staff personnel clear examples of how content could be grouped, arranged, and interacted with that gave everyone involved great insight into how workflows needed to be streamlined to improve the overall experience.</p>

				<p>Using the latest version of Convio, we created a stylized site pushing Convio to its boundaries. To reduce time and costs, we customized templates to fit Clean Cookstoves’ Convio objectives.</p>

				<h2>Data & Statistics Support</h2>
				<p>In order to provide a robust data and statistical analysis section on the site, we had to step outside of what Convio was capable of supporting. This led to the creation of a custom <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> module that made it easy for site audiences to view country-based statistics using the custom filtering mechanisms and sorting capabilities.</p>

				<h2>Improved Search</h2>
				<p>We improved search functionality by using a custom filtering mechanism built from a Rails module. Our goal was to make it easy for audiences to access specific statistical data regarding cookstoves technology and various demographic / socio-graphic information in different countries for analysis and comparison.</p>

				<h2>Custom Reporting</h2>
				<p>We compiled various pulling techniques to allow audiences to quickly analyze the data stored internally to help communicate the overall story. We provided several different types of mechanisms to sort and find the right information using filtering, sorting, and categorization techniques.</p>

				<h2>Enhanced Data Analysis</h2>
				<p>Whether it is with sortable lists, filter mechanisms, or keyword searching, we made sure that it was easy for users to access all of the valuable resources and tools. With improved search functionality on the site, it is simple for audiences to easily discover the information they need.</p>

				<h2>Targeting Business + Site Goals</h2>
				<p>To meet Clean Cookstoves’ goal of increasing awareness and mobilizing partners, we set up a few steps to maximize the return on investment. We provided support for Clean Cookstoves to develop engaging campaigns and target select audience groups to meet their strategic goals.</p>

				<p><strong>Decreased bounce rate from 93% to 48%</strong> in a 7 month period, <strong>increased the average visit duration to 4 minutes and 35 seconds,</strong> and by the end of the 7 month period, there were <strong>86,120 visits—54.80% of them consisting of new visits.</strong></p>

				<h2>Outreach Support</h2>
				<p>To support UNF with their ongoing outreach requirements and connect target audiences to valuable resources for the Clean Cookstoves Campaign, we created and developed enhanced online newsletter templates. This proved to be a great outreach asset and allowed UNF to track successes. The newsletters direct readers back to the website where they can do further research, be part of the community, or take action.</p>
