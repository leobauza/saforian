		<h1>Northern Virginia Technology Council</h1>
		<article class="row-fluid">
			<div class="span6">
				<p>The Northern Virginia Technology Council (NVTC) is the largest technology council in the nation, representing about 200,000 employees in the region through its member companies. NVTC serves approximately 1,000 companies from all sectors of the technology industry as well as universities, nonprofits, government agencies, foreign embassies, and service providers. NVTC came to us to refresh their online presence, integrate social functionality, and make it easy for members to navigate through their extensive resources. We redesigned the website to better suit NVTC’s objectives and organizational needs and developed a streamlined approach to move members through the site.</p>

				<h2>Informational Architecture</h2>
				<p>Our engineers started by gathering requirements and evaluating NVTC’s large collection of information. During our functional design activity we created an optimized organizational structure that provides better groupings to the content and feature sets throughout. We then made deep dives into formulating the required page-level content hierarchies and functionality needed to support the site’s overall requirements.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Once we finalized a new organizational structure, we moved forward with creating navigational models and extensive wireframing prototypes to test potential solutions to page-level and section-level challenges. In particular, the home page wireframe was developed to create simple and direct access points for key information.</p>

				<h2>Homepage Design</h2>
				<p>Once we fully defined the organized structure for the data, we turned to our designers to create a fresh, clean look to give audiences an easy and effective way to discover content. From the redesigned home page, existing members can now quickly access relevant NVTC news and potential members can easily apply for membership.</p>

				<h2>Community</h2>
				<p>To create a social environment for members, we focused on converting passive browsing into active community participation to add value for all audiences. With the goal of engaging members, we designed the site to highlight important information and networking opportunities like upcoming council events and activities.</p>

				<h2>Navigational Models</h2>
				<p>To improve the user experience, we created navigational models to make the site easy to navigate. We streamlined the main sections of the site to provide better content groupings and created drop down menus to give audiences the ability to jump to tertiary pages more efficiently.</p>
