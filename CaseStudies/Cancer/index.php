				<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is the federal government’s principal agency for cancer research and training. We were approached by NCI to present a conceptual model of how the site could better meet the needs of their diverse audience. We took a step back and brainstormed new ways to engage the site’s core audiences to establish Cancer.gov as the premier platform for providing both educational content and social interaction. Our vision was to create a compelling interactive experience that allowed visitors to interact to make informed decisions about diagnoses, treatment options, and support initiatives. Our deliverable included content organization concepts, engagement diagrams, potential navigation models, improved content delivery capabilities as well as a visual exploration of an improved home page design.</p>

				<h2>Informational Architecture</h2>
				<p>We created an optimized organizational structure that provides better groupings to the content and feature sets throughout. Our interactive engineers first gathered requirements regarding NCI’s diverse audience groups and outreach plans. We then formulated the required page-level content hierarchies and functionality needed to support the site’s requirements and to minimize any unnecessary steps for visitors along their journeys through the site. Using our defined audience goals and objectives, we incorporated refinements, paving the way for streamlined pathways and optimized navigational controls.</p>

				<h2>Social Interaction</h2>
				<p>Just about every single person on this planet knows someone who has been affected by cancer. We created a platform to provide connection possibilities for NCI’s target audience—patients, family members, doctors, nurses, practitioners, and support providers­—to help them make informed health decisions.</p>

				<h2>Personalization</h2>
				<p>To cater to NCI’s diverse audience, we created a concept that focuses on providing personalization capabilities. We developed specialized content portals to give visitors more control over which content is displayed.</p>

				<h2>Navigational Models</h2>
				<p>Once we determined how the organizational structure should function, we created various navigational models to test scenarios against labeling, order, and placement. We defined navigational models to demonstrate how structures could be navigated and to determine the best approach.</p>
