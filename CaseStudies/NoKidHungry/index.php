			<div class="span6">
				<p>Share Our Strength reached out to Saforian to create a multi-faceted, interactive digital experience to bring the No Kid Hungry campaign to life. We analyzed the target audiences and goals of the No Kid Hungry campaign to develop a compelling, streamlined approach to move users through the desired activities. Using HTML5, we developed a compelling opportunity for individuals to increase awareness in their communities and express their commitment to fighting childhood hunger. We integrated Drupal 6 to enable Share Our Strength to easily update their content on the fly and used Convio as the main CRM solution to ensure changes made to the site and back-end CMS system integrated seamlessly.</p>

				<h2>Custom Drupal Modules</h2>
				<p>Using the Saforian installed Drupal framework, we created a compelling interactive experience for Strength’s new site. To minimize costs, we built on existing modules and used our custom Drupal components like Multimedia Carousel and Menu.</p>

				<h2>Actions</h2>
				<p>We created and presented a variety of specific action opportunities in a graphically clean and direct interface that individuals could directly apply to their own lives and in their communities. These action opportunities are tailored to Strength’s diverse audience, making it easy for users to make a contribution in whatever way they can—whether it is signing the pledge, writing a letter to the editor, or making a donation.</p>

				<h2>Responsive Blog Module</h2>
				<p>We architected the site to encourage visitors to take the No Kid Hungry Pledge and add their voices to the growing national movement. We created an effective module that allows individuals to easily pledge their support. The module was also made available for partners to place anywhere to increase pledges. In a one-year period, Strength saw steady increases in pledge numbers. </p>

						<h2>Mapping</h2>
						<p>To grab the audience’s attention, it is more effective to show instead of tell. Through detailed mapping functionality, we created a wireframe of an interactive map of the United States to visually communicate the geographic impact of Strength’s efforts. It helps the audience identify where the problem exists and where individuals and partners are active in supporting the cause. This visual representation compels individuals to get involved to be a part of the community effort to fight childhood hunger.</p>

						<p>We enhanced Strength’s social media networks with the goal of converting social followers to pledge-takers and then donors. As a result, Facebook followers increased by 154% in a one-year period. In a 6-month period, Twitter followers increased by 31%.</p>

				<h2>Informational Architecture</h2>
				<p>Our goal was to create an organizational structure to communicate Strength’s compelling story and mission. One of the main issues with Strength’s previous site was that it didn’t clearly identify how they functioned as an organization and how individuals could make an impact through contributing and donating. We created a simplified approach to ensure the audience could easily identify what each section was geared toward. In addition to telling Strength’s story, we architected the site to be action-oriented to motivate individuals to get involved. In addition, we used our interactive prototypes to collaborate with Strength’s internal teams to identify functionality needed to depict appropriate stories and communicate content effectively.</p>

				<h2>Navigational Models</h2>
				<p>Our goal was to develop an effective structure to tell Strength’s story, get individuals involved, and clearly communicate how to become an advocate for fighting childhood hunger. After we determined how the organizational structure should work, we put together navigational models to test scenarios against labeling, order, and placement. We began with organizational design to ensure we created an organizational structure that works to best house site content. Then, we defined navigational models to allow us to navigate the organizational structure.</p>

				<h2>Interactive Stories</h2>
				<p>Telling a story is a chance to make the audience care about what you are doing. The interactive story section on Strength’s website grabs users’ attention and helps them deeply connect and empathize with Strength’s mission by giving them a personal stake in the matter. As a result, it is easier to ask for their help. We included a story section on Strength’s website to make Strength's mission of fighting childhood hunger personal by showing real people in dire need of help.</p>
