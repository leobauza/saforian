		<h1>No Kid Hungry</h1>
		<article class="row-fluid">
			<div class="span6">
				<p>As a long-time valuable partner, Share Our Strength reached out to us to create a multi-faceted, interactive digital experience to bring the No Kid Hungry campaign to life. Combining our knowledge of the non profit industry and Strength’s needs, we worked hand-in-hand to identify the target audiences and goals of the No Kid Hungry campaign. While developing a compelling, streamlined approach to move users through the site, we aimed to empower users with a voice—a voice to raise awareness and share their commitment in fighting childhood hunger.</p>

				<h2>Custom Drupal Modules</h2>
				<p>Using the Saforian installed Drupal 7 Responsive framework, we created a compelling interactive experience for Strength’s new site. To minimize costs, we built on existing modules and created a few custom Drupal components like Multimedia Carousel and a new Menu module.</p>

				<h2>Actions</h2>
				<p>We created and presented a variety of specific action opportunities in a graphically clean and direct interface that individuals could directly apply to their own lives and in their communities. These action opportunities are tailored to Strength’s diverse audience, making it easy for users to make a contribution in whatever way they can—whether it is signing the pledge, writing a letter to the editor, or making a donation.</p>

				<h2>Responsive Blog Module</h2>
				<p>Strength needed an effective blog module to make it easy for supporters to connect and share content. We created a blog module that is scalable and easy to navigate to find resources. In addition, it is adaptable to work across a variety of platforms to cater to Strength’s diverse audience.</p>

				<h2>Pledge System Integration</h2>
				<p>We architected the site to encourage visitors to take the No Kid Hungry Pledge and add their voices to the growing national movement. We created an effective module that allows individuals to easily pledge their support. The module was also made available for partners to place anywhere to increase pledges. <strong>In a one-year period, Strength saw steady increases in pledge numbers.</strong></p>

						<h2>Mapping Your Audience</h2>
						<p>Visuals speak louder than words. Through detailed mapping functionality, we created an interactive map of the United States to visually communicate the geographic impact of Strength’s efforts. It helped the audience identify where the problem exists and where individuals and partners are active in supporting the cause. This visual representation compels individuals to take a stand in the community effort to fight childhood hunger.</p>

						<h2>Stats</h2>
						<p>We enhanced Strength’s social media networks with the goal of converting social followers to pledge-takers and then donors. As a result, <strong>Facebook followers increased by 154%</strong> in a one-year period. In a 6-month period, <strong>Twitter followers increased by 31%.</strong></p>

				<h2>Informational Architecture</h2>
				<p>Our goal was to create an organizational structure to communicate Strength’s inspiring story and mission. Strength’s previous site didn’t clearly identify how they functioned as an organization and how individuals could make an impact through contributing or donating. We created a simplified approach to ensure the audience could easily identify the “so what?” of each section. In addition to telling Strength’s story, we architected the site to be action-oriented, motivating individuals to get involved. In addition, we used our interactive prototypes to collaborate with Strength’s internal teams to identify functionality needed to depict appropriate stories and communicate content effectively.</p>

				<h2>Navigational Models</h2>
				<p>After we determined how the organizational structure should work, we put together navigational models to test scenarios against labeling, order, and placement. We began with organizational design to ensure we created an organizational structure that works to best house site content. Then, we defined navigational models to allow us to navigate the organizational structure.</p>

				<h2>Interactive Stories</h2>
				<p>Telling a story is a chance to make the audience care about your cause. The interactive story section on Strength’s website grabs users’ attention and helps them deeply connect and empathize with Strength’s mission. We included a story section on Strength’s website to make Strength's mission of fighting childhood hunger personal by showing real people in dire need of help.</p>
