			<!-- <h3>What is Drupal CMS</h3> -->
			<p>Writing an effective RFP is all about communicating your wants and needs clearly and concisely. Begin the proposal by identifying specific goals your business wants to achieve with the RFP, including which features must be included and which features are desirable but non-essential. Specify what you need, rather than how it has to be done, unless a specific execution is essential.</p>
			<p>List out project requirements, explaining how you will select a winning proposal and detailing the project’s timeline and process. Organize the RFP clearly and logically, since it’s your way of explaining to bidders what you want to achieve. Send the RFP by mail or email or publish it online. When delivering it, target a range of vendors to get a good selection of features and prices in bids. Remember that more complicated RFPs demand more complex bids. Give bidders sufficient time to prepare and submit their proposals.</p>
