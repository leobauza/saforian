			<p>New rules of marketing and public relations have changed the ways consumers receive and respond to information. Today’s most successful brands, regardless of size, industry, or organizational model, are those that integrate both inbound and outbound marketing tactics as part of a multi-channel marketing program.</p>

			<p>Inbound marketing focuses on getting found by consumers organically rather than pushing a traditional self-promotional message out to the masses. By generating truly “remarkable” content and distributing it in the consumer-to-consumer driven marketplace that is social media, target audiences naturally gravitate to it and share or “remark” within their networks. Word of mouth marketing is then taken to an  exponential level of sharing now known as “word-of-mouse” or “world-of- mouth” marketing.</p>

			<p>There are three primary objectives that serve as the core equation for inbound marketing: 1) getting found online, 2) converting traffic into leads, and 3) analyzing results.</p>

			<p>First, we focus on getting found by driving traffic to your social media networks and website. We follow content resources and online influencers based on buyer persona and keyword research, and then we share it in our top social media networks every day during optimal times. This act of sharing content in various newsfeeds, often with a headline and link to a blog article, is known as <i>microblogging.</i></p>

			<p>Driving traffic to your website with original content is our ultimate goal. We will develop a master publishing schedule to repurpose existing content and create new interesting and relevant original content on your blog. By creating new content on your website regularly, we will add page depth optimized with keywords which optimizes your site for search engines and drives further traffic to your website.</p>

			<p>Next, we turn our attention to conversion campaign. If our strategy is to increase social media reach first, we will launch the initial conversion campaign in our top social media network. Facebook, for example, is the largest social media network so we may consider launching a Facebook fan drive or contest to cast a net across our target audience and convert them into fans. If our goal is to drive traffic directly to a website and convert qualified leads in the form of email addresses, then we may launch a whitepaper or eBook download campaign.</p>

			<p>Every conversion campaign needs a home, so landing page or tab development will be required that includes design and copywriting expertise. It is on this page or tab that your audience must complete a call to action in order to receive the benefit identified within the campaign (i.e. contest incentive, whitepaper download, etc.). Once the conversions take place, a lead nurturing plan will be implemented to further warm the leads for the eventual close.</p>

			<p>Once all strategies are in place and campaigns are executed, we will work with you and your staff to monitor analytics data and optimize channels and campaigns accordingly. We recommend using <strong>Google Analytics</strong> to monitor website traffic, Facebook Insights to monitor Facebook engagement, as well as other free or low cost online monitoring tools.</p>
