			<!-- <h3>What is Drupal CMS</h3> -->
			<p>As consumers become more selective about the content they consume, outbound marketing efforts that use traditional mass media such as TV, newspaper, and radio are losing effectiveness. Inbound marketing takes advantage of social media networks to reverse the discovery process, allowing consumers to discover a brand organically by creating content they want to engage with.</p>
			<p>To succeed with inbound marketing, consumers must discover your content, requiring you to bring in traffic by promoting yourself and being cross-promoted by other content producers who align with your business goals. Next, traffic must be converted into leads, after which the entire process is analyzed and repeated. From content creation to closing the deal with customers, our savvy social media experts will work with your team to design, deploy, and refine a comprehensive inbound marketing strategy.</p>
