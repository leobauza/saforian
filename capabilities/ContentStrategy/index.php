			<!-- <h3>What is Drupal CMS</h3> -->
			<p>Writing for the web poses a different set of challenges than writing for print applications, simply because users digest content differently on the web. They quickly scan pages for keywords and phrases, hunting for the information they need to move to the next page quickly. Effective web writing involves the right content, style, and format that will allow users to scan your site efficiently.</p>
			<p>Assume that users visiting your website are there for information, and how well you provide it will ultimately determine your success. The audience’s needs must drive your content and presentation, so avoid mission statements, unintuitive content divisions, and overly formal prose or self-important marketing speak. Follow a “reverse pyramid” writing style similar to journalism, in which you lead with the most important details, allowing readers to quickly identify the content they seek.</p>
