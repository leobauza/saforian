			<h3>with Salesforce</h3>
			<p>As the most widely used CRM program solution on the Internet, Salesforce can deliver endless benefits to your organization: better communication, increased customer retention, increased profitability, more targeted marketing, and thorough prospect tracking. It eliminates the need for any hardware or software installation because everything runs on cloud servers, making it easy to run your organization on the go.</p>
			<p>At Saforian, we eat, sleep, and breathe Drupal. Drupal has an infinite ability to adapt itself to address specific business needs, making it our architecture of choice. Linking one of the most powerful CRMs, Salesforce, with one of the most powerful CMSs, Drupal, can help organizations maintain a more dynamic web presence.</p>
			<p>Our clients often request integration between Drupal and Salesforce. We carefully evaluate your needs and budget to determine the best Drupal-Salesforce integration model. Most integrations fall into four categories: user synchronization, donation/e-commerce integration, webform integration, and e-mail campaign integration. Each has advantages and drawbacks, and we will work closely with you to determine the best approach.</p>
