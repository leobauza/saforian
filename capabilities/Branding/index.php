			<h3></h3>
			<p>A brand is an amalgam of visual and verbal characteristics, both rational and emotional, that help provide differentiation in the hearts and minds of consumers.</p>

			<p>Criteria for Success:
				<ul>
					<li>Equity and positioning</li>
					<li>Memorable and differentiating</li>
					<li>Easy to understand</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Naming:</h3>
			
			<p>Great names are a powerful force for the companies they work flikr. They differentiate you from competitors, make an emotional connection with your audience, and help to build a brand that evokes the passions of your customers.</p>
			
			<p>A name can:
				<ul>
					<li>Separate you from your competitors</li>
					<li>Show the world that you are different</li>
					<li>Reinforce a unique positioning platform</li>
					<li>Create positive and lasting engagement with your audience</li>
					<li>Make you unforgettable</li>
					<li>Become no-cost, self sustaining PR vehicle</li>
					<li>Provide a deep well of marketing and advertising images</li>
					<li>Be the genesis of a brand that rises above the goods and services you provide</li>
					<li>Completely dominate a category</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>There are typically four categories in which product or companynames fall into:
				<ul>
					<li>Functional</li>
					<li>Invented</li>
					<li>Experiential</li>
					<li>Evocative</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>All four categories have positives (+) and negatives (-).</p>
			
			<p><b>Functional Names:</b></p>
			<p>Examples: Subway, Martha Stewart, U.S. Airways</p>
			
			<p>Direct bulk of the brand equity is related to the company name</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The name only performs one task</li>
					<li>Because these names are common in their categories, they become indistinguishable from the majority of their competitors</li>
					<li>They are hard to trademark</li>
					<li>They are not unique</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Invented Names:</b></p>
			<p>There are generally two types of invented names:</p>
			
			<p>A) Names derived from Greek or Latin roots<br/>Examples: Acquient, Agilent, Alliant</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Free from negative connotations</li>
					<li>Serious sounding</li>
					<li>Hard for consumers to attach meaning to</li>
					<li>Difficult to remember or pronounce</li>
					<li>Can sound cold and sanitized</li>
					<li>Image-free and emotionally void (little potential marketing energy)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
					
			<p>A) Poetically constructed names based on rhythm and the experience of saying them<br/>
			Examples: Snapple, Google, Oreo</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Target audience likes saying these fun names</li>
					<li>Highly memorable</li>
					<li>Emotionally engaging</li>
					<li>Rich with marketing energy</li>
					<li>Typically difficult to get corporate approval for</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Experiential Names</b></p>
			<p>Examples: Infoseek, Explorer, Safari</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Make sense to the consumer</li>
					<li>Relate the experience to the product</li>
					<li>Most effective for early entrants into a business sector</li>
					<li>Common / high frequency in many sectors</li>
					<li>Over-usage makes them less effective (For example Explorer and Safari are also car names. These names say the same thing in the same way to the same audience.)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Evocative Names</b></p>
			<p>Examples: Yahoo, Apple, Crest</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Evokes the positioning of a product, rather than describing a function or direct experience</li>
					<li>Rare and different</li>
					<li>Multidimensional, making the name highly engaging</li>
					<li>Can become a branding force that dominates its industry</li>
					<li>When created out of sync with brand positioning, it’s not effective</li>
					<li>Typically difficult to get corporate approval for</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p><b>Remember:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Discovering good names is virtually never love at first sight</li>
					<li>A name that looks and sounds a little different could have the unique edge that makes it memorable</li>
					<li>A name that promotes an idea that’s different from everything else in the market, could be the name consumers remember in the end</li>
					<li>Be willing to consider something different than what you have in mind right now</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>Structured exploration is key to the effective development of a name. Whether functional, invented, experiential or evocative, the right name captures the essence of the cause and the organization at hand. Many good ideas can emerge, but it's essential to focus ideas so the final name isn't just good, it's right.</p>
			
			<h3>Taglines</h3>
			
			<p>Taglines can fall into these four categories as well. It is often best to pair names and taglines from different categories. Example: Evocative name with a Functional tagline.</p>
			
			<h3>Finding your voice:</h3>
			
			<p>Keep this brief less than 10 words if possible. Keep it clear and free of jargon.  It may take you sometime to refine this in plain language. This should be how you talk about your organization around your friends. Simple and to the point.</p>
			
			<p>Saforian: We build Websites and tools to help organizations succeed online.</p>
			
			<p>If your brand could talk, how would it speak? What sorts of things would it say? Would it speak with a folksy vernacular or a refined, erudite clip? Describe the specific aspects of your brands voice, and how it might change in various communication situations. People change their language and tone to fit the situation, and so should the voice of your brand.</p>
			
			<p>Examples:</p>

			<p>Here are two examples of how we have changed the voice to talk about the same organization to two types of people. Mind & Matter is set as a tone for a more passive persona while Be the Change is for the advocate persona.</p>

			<p>Mind & Matter</p>

			<p>A child’s mind is a vast and wonderful place, full of so much potential, so many questions and so active an imagination. Inside the mind’s eye, anything is possible…worlds are created, games are invented and imaginary friends are born. Life blossoms in beautifully vivid color. Here, where reality and make-believe mingle, kids become kids. And in pushing the boundaries of who they are, they discover themselves.</p>

			<p>Be the Change</p>

			<p>Progression is a part of life. And now, it’s a part of education. We’ve researched, reinvented and revolutionized. With one unprecedented program, we’re helping kids who need it most, at the age they need it most. We’re changing the course of early childhood education. Starting kids sooner in life, for later, greater success. At the forefront of education, we teach, inspire and innovate. Becoming the change the world needs.</p>
			
			<h3>Your Mark:</h3>
			<p>Can fall into the four categories and guidelines mentioned above:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Functional</li>
					<li>Invented</li>
					<li>Experiential</li>
					<li>Evocative</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Defining your Colors:</h3>
			
			<p>Usually, it is advantageous for a brand to consistently “own” certain colors, which provide an additional recognition cue. Colors are an important part of any brand identity system.  Testing the affect of a new brand identity system’s colors is well advised.  It is important to consider that color associations will vary by individual, and especially culture, due to the cultural context and previous experiences with the colors.</p>
			
			<p>Saforian: We use only black and white stylings and allow color to be displayed in our projects and images only.</p>
			
			<h3>Constraining Your Brand:</h3>
			
			<p>A style guide creates and defines the standards for internal and external corporate documents. It serves as a reference source and training tool for anyone who reads or writes documentation, which is to say, everyone. A style guide will provide many benefits to your company:</p>
			
			<p>Time Savings. A style guide saves time by providing quick answers to questions that may arise while writing documentation. "What information should be included in a specification?" or "How should I format the address on this letter?" A style guide streamlines the process of composition, thus significantly reducing the time required to create new documents. It also provides for shorter review cycles.</p>
				
			<p>Cost Savings. Employees with access to their company's style guide spend fewer hours writing, reviewing, and correcting documentation. A style guide reduces the expense of repetitive training and prevents costly mistakes that result when an operator, for instance, is forced to read inconsistent or poorly written operating instructions./p>
				
			<p>Consistency. A style guide promotes consistency among documents throughout the company. This leads to fewer arguments over questions of style and format and to less duplicated effort, resulting in savings of both time and money.</p>
			
			<p>Professionalism. In helping to write and maintain a style guide, employees have an opportunity to share their expertise and knowledge internally. Externally, your company enhances its image by developing and using an effective time- and money-management tool and by consistently producing quality documentation.</p>
				
			<h3>Brand Rollout:</h3>
			
			<p>It’s time for the launch of your new brand. This brand won’t take off overnight. Most companies take a phased approach that can last up to a year.</p>
				
			<p>The first step should be an internal launch. This is an opportunity to strengthen the bond between your company’s vision and employees, and align to specific goals.</p>
			
			<p>Two external phases should follow. The first is about gathering all branding and marketing materials that can be prepared quickly and before initial release to the public. The second phase covers things that take more time to prepare, or may not be needed at the beginning of the launch.</p>
			
			<p>The following sample rollout lists materials to consider when organizing your brand rollout. Creating your own lists can be a collaborative process that actually makes the brand rollout easier. Internal buy-in gets everyone involved and helps organize ideas, creating a customized list that sets priorities and outlines the goals of the launch.</p>
			
			<p><b>Internal Launch:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Logo</li>
					<li>"Key themes and messages" document</li>
					<li>Visual guidelines document</li>
					<li>1 Page document filling the gap between LaunchPad and CAP</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p><b>2 External Launch Phase 1</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Advertising: print, radio, online, and TV</li>
					<li>Business cards</li>
					<li>Direct mail</li>
					<li>Envelopes</li>
					<li>Fax forms</li>
					<li>Letterhead</li>
					<li>Mailing label</li>
					<li>Newsletter</li>
					<li>Press releases</li>
					<li>Stationery</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p><b>3 External Launch Phase 2</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Signage</li>
					<li>Brochures</li>
					<li>E-mails and E-newsletters</li>

				</ul>
