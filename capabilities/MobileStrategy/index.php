			<p class="intro-paragraph">Saforian groups mobile site design into three categories: accessible for mobile, optimized for mobile, and custom apps. All three approaches provide access to a site via a mobile device, but with different presentations and levels of accessibility.  Each approach has its benefits and trade-offs. Saforian works closely with our clients to analyze their needs and goals, to determine which approach presents the greatest value proposition for their business.</p>

					<h3>Mobile Accessible</h3>
					<p>Today’s smartphones have fairly sophisticated browsers, capable of rendering most sites correctly without any additional design work. Saforian codes everything to make sure it looks ok no matter what device it is being accessed from.</p>
					<p>These browsers typically provide a full site experience and offer the ability to zoom in to certain locations for a close-up view. If all your site needs is the ability to work on today’s smartphones, you need a mobile accessible site. This is the least intensive approach of the three.</p>

					<h3>Mobile Optimized</h3>
					<p>However, not all mobile devices are created equal. To create a site that’s optimized for mobile, your site has to adjust based on the device used to view it. Different devices, different screen resolutions, and adjustments to the viewing window mean that your site’s layout and content must adapt.</p>
					<p>By incorporating more responsive design elements than a simple mobile accessible treatment, mobile optimization provides a better experience for users, no matter how they view your site.</p>

					<h3>Custom Mobile App</h3>
					<p>With the advent of mobile apps, app markets, and online stores, users are inundated with an ever growing number of apps, with almost infinite purposes and capabilities. Depending on your specific business goals it can be beneficial to have a custom app available via an app store or marketplace.</p>
					<p>An app can offer a completely new avenue for clients to interact with your business, and can provide exposure to users who would otherwise have never encountered your brand.</p>
