			<p>Saforian groups mobile site design into three categories: mobile accessible, mobile optimized, and custom apps. All three approaches provide a mobile-ready site, but with different presentations and degrees of accessibility. Your site might need basic mobile browser functionality (mobile accessible), or might require responsive design elements that adapt it for a wide range of browsers and devices (mobile optimized). In some cases, a custom application might provide the best medium to interact with your clients and give exposure to your brand.</p>
			<p>Each approach has benefits and trade-offs. Saforian will work with you to identify the best structure to deliver engaging content to your audience in the format they prefer. Whether your site is mobile accessible, mobile optimized, or delivered via a custom application, Saforian will create an intuitive solution for the best value for your business.</p>
