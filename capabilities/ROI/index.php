			<!-- <h3>What is Drupal CMS</h3> -->
			<p>At Saforian, we believe in measuring success for our clients based on what we like to call our ROG (Return on Goals).  ROG is a comprehensive approach of looking at the success of a project beyond just the standard ROI (Return on Investment).  Although ROI is a great component to measure success, we believe that holistic success comes from a measuring against a variety of goals.</p>
			<p>ROG starts with helping you clearly define your online and mobile goals at the beginning of any project.  It’s the most important part of any initiative. It’s why you are in business, running a campaign, or raising awareness. We help you vocalize, launch, track, and measure the success of your goals. That’s why we are in business—it’s the driving force behind everything we do. It’s the reason we take on projects, the reason we get excited about technology, and the main reason clients hire us. Sure, we take pride in producing aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly, goal-focused digital solutions, but that alone does not quantify a success for us or you. It’s all about accomplishing your goals!</p>
			<p>Whether the goal of your project is to increase the percentage of mobile users, boost your website’s traffic, or increase your target audience engagement, we strive to ensure your project has a strong ROG with the ability to be tracked and measured along the way.</p>
