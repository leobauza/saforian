			<!-- <h3>What is Drupal CMS</h3> -->
			<p>A critical component of developing an effective solution is understanding the challenge at hand and deciphering the details for what needs to be built. The research process allows us to define the whatâ€”what exists that we need to manage and integrate with in order to establish a strong plan of action.</p>
			<p>Through focused discussions with your team, Saforian will work to identify the requirements, desires, needs, and overall objectives required for the project to be a success. Understanding what drives your business and how your existing technical landscape functions is key to our research and planning process. We will identify target audience groups and set specific goals and objectives for each. Further, to determine integration needs, we will pinpoint the appropriate inputs and outputs as well as where data is coming from and where it needs to go.</p>
